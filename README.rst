Tools for dealing with Unique Molecular Identifiers
====================================================

This repository contains tools for dealing with Unique Molecular
Identifiers (UMIs)/Random Molecular Tags (RMTs) and single cell
RNA-Seq cell barcodes. Currently there are 6
commands. 

The ``extract`` and ``whitelist`` commands are used to prepare a
fastq containg UMIs +/- cell barcodes for alignment. 

* whitelist:
   **Builds a whitelist of the 'real' cell barcodes**
      This is useful for droplet-based single cell RNA-Seq where the
      identity of the true cell barcodes is unknown. Whitelist can
      then be used to filter with extract (see below)

* extract:
   **Flexible removal of UMI sequences from fastq reads.**
      UMIs are removed and appended to the read name. Any other
      barcode, for example a library barcode, is left on the read. Can
      also filter reads by quality or against a whitelist (see above)

The remaining commands, ``group``, ``dedup`` and ``count``/``count_tab``, are used to
identify PCR duplicates using the UMIs and perform different levels of
analysis depending on the needs of the user. A number of different UMI
deduplication schemes are enabled - The recommended method is
*directional*.

* dedup:
   **Groups PCR duplicates and deduplicates reads to yield one read per group**
      Use this when you want to remove the PCR duplicates prior to any
      downstream analysis

* group: 
   **Groups PCR duplicates using the same methods available through `dedup`.**
      This is useful when you want to manually interrogate the PCR duplicates
   
* count:
   **Groups and deduplicates PCR duplicates and counts the unique molecules per gene**
      Use this when you want to obtain a matrix with unique molecules
      per gene, per cell, for scRNA-Seq.

* count_tab:
   **As per count except input is a flatfile**

See `QUICK_START.md <./doc/QUICK_START.md>`_ for a quick tutorial on
the most common usage pattern.

If you want to use UMI-tools in single-cell RNA-Seq data processing,
see `Single_cell_tutorial.md <./doc/Single_cell_tutorial.md>`_

**Important update**: We now recommend the use of `alevin` for droplet-based
scRNA-Seq (e.g 10X, inDrop etc). `alevin` is an accurate, fast and convenient end-to-end tool to go from fastq -> count matrix and  extends the UMI error correction in `UMI-tools` within a framework that also enables quantification of droplet scRNA-Seq without discarding multi-mapped reads.  See `alevin documentation <https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html>`_ and `alevin pre-print <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/335000v2>`_ for more information

The ``dedup``, ``group``, and ``count`` / ``count_tab`` commands make use of network-based methods to resolve similar UMIs with the same alignment coordinates. For a background regarding these methods see:

`Genome Research Publication <http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2017/01/18/gr.209601.116.abstract>`_
